Pushing Changes to GitHub:

    Link Your Repository to GitHub:
        Ensure you have a GitHub repository created where you want to push your local changes.
        In VS Code, go to the Source Control view.
        Click on the ellipsis (...) next to your repository name and select "Publish to GitHub".
        Follow the prompts to sign in to your GitHub account, select the repository to push to, and confirm.

    Push Changes:
        After the initial setup, you can push your commits to GitHub.
        Click the ellipsis (...) next to your repository name in the Source Control view and select "Push".
        VS Code will push your commits to the remote repository (GitHub).

Additional Tips:

    Branching: Use the Source Control view to create and switch branches, merge changes, and manage your Git workflow directly within VS Code.

    Pulling Changes: Before pushing changes, it's good practice to pull any updates from the remote repository (Pull option in the Source Control view).

    Git History: Use the Git History view (View > Git History or Ctrl+Shift+G) to see detailed commit history, compare versions, and revert changes if necessary.
